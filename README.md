# Q-Learning-Gym-Cartpole

This repository implements Q-learning for the cart pole task using OpenAI Gym. The gym module provides an abstraction for Markov decision processes, enabling the rapid development and test
of reinforcement learning algorithms. Instructions about Cartpole Gym can be found under https://github.com/openai/gym.
